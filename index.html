    <h1>Executive Summary</h1>
    <p>The Wildfire Project is a non-profit organization that seeks to address the always-relevant issue of wildfires.
      Wildfires are destructive. They take homes, ecosystems, and lives. We believe we must track current
      wildfires, educate the misinformed, raise awareness for our cause, create a safe space for victims, and refer
      the eagerness for opportunities to help.</p>

    <br><br>

    <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
    <p>At The Wildfire Project, we pledge ourselves to the care of wildfire victims and the prevention of possible
      wildfires. We aim to make positive change, one step at a time, to protect ourselves, our homes, our families, our
      livelihoods, and our planet. Every action we take today is to create a safer, more sustainable environment for
      tomorrow. In every wildfire, every second counts. Join us today.</p>

    <h2>How to Avoid Wildfires</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid outdoor activities involving fire or sparks on hot, dry, and windy days.</li>
      <li>Carry essential firefighting tools like a shovel, bucket, and fire extinguisher in your vehicle.</li>
      <li>Ensure cigarettes are properly extinguished and never discard them in dry vegetation.</li>
      <li>Keep campfires small, contained, and away from flammable materials.</li>
      <li>Always supervise campfires and make sure they are completely extinguished before leaving.</li>
      <li>Maintain vehicles to prevent sparks from exhaust systems and dragging metal parts.</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>

    <h2>How Wildfires Start</h2>
    <p>Most wildfires are caused by human activities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Equipment malfunction, such as power lines or machinery sparks.</li>
      <li>Discarded cigarettes that ignite dry vegetation.</li>
      <li>Unattended campfires that spread due to wind.</li>
      <li>Arson and intentional fire-setting.</li>
    </ul>
