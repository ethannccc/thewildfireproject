        <h1>HOW DO FIRES START?</h1>
        <p id="wildfireStart">Most wildfires are caused by human activities:</p>
        <p>Wildfires can originate from various human activities, including equipment malfunctions
          such as power lines or machinery sparks. In addition, discarded cigarettes can pose a significant threat by
          igniting dry vegetation. Unattended campfires, especially in windy conditions, can quickly escalate and
          spread. Unfortunately, some wildfires are deliberately set through acts of arson and intentional fire-setting.
          It is crucial to raise awareness about these causes and promote responsible behavior to minimize the risk of
          wildfires.
